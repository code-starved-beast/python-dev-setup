# Python Developer Environment Setup

## What this includes
Just a few of my favorite open-source developer tools for a fancier and more user-friendly terminal

+ [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for Mac OSX
+ [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), a python version manager
+ [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), a wicked fancy zsh theme that will make you feel like Mr. Robot

## You should also download

+ either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the two best text editors out ther
+ [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) if you're not yet comfortable using the git CLI and you don't want to use the built-in git plugins for Atom or VSCode

## Actual Setup Instructions

1) Download [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html), a cross-platform, open-source terminal app (it's better than the preinstalls mac terminal app)
2) clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/code-starved-beast/python-dev-setup.git`
3) `cd python-dev-setup && sh ./setup_env.sh`
4) after that runs, `cd && p10k configure` and follow the onscreen wizard
5) enjoy your beautiful new terminal!
